# Quick Reference - Enhanced Linux Tutorial System

## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Instructors

### 1. Generate Answer Keys
```bash
python StudentToGroup.py
```

### 2. Essential Steps
1. **Set Assignment Key** (Option 1)
   - Use descriptive names: `BasicNav_Week3`, `FileOps_Final`
   
2. **Generate Master Answer Key** (Option 6)
   - Input: Student list file (`students.txt`)
   - Output: CSV with all student codes
   
3. **Validate Student Submissions**
   - Compare student codes with CSV answer key

### 3. Enhanced Exercise Structure
| Lesson | Exercises | Practice Focus | Sample Questions |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Basic Navigation | 10 | Navigate directories, file size analysis | "List files with sizes using ls -l Documents/" |
| Document Content Exploration | 10 | Read content, search real documents | "How many students study Computer Science?" |  
| File Operations | 10 | Create, copy, move, delete files | "Create and manipulate test files" |
| Text Processing | 10 | Text creation, search, manipulation | "Search and process text content" |
| Permissions | 10 | Modify script permissions, compare types | "Make script.sh executable" |
| Complete Tutorial | 50 | Full Linux workflow with realistic files | Comprehensive assessment |

### 4. Sample Files Included (Documents/ directory)
| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| small.txt | 12 bytes | Size comparison practice |
| script.sh | 108 bytes | Permissions exercises |
| students.txt | 163 bytes | Grep search practice |
| README.txt | 205 bytes | Cat command practice |
| commands.txt | 331 bytes | Reference documentation |
| medium.txt | 519 bytes | Multi-line content |
| project.txt | 1,775 bytes | Large file analysis |

### 4. Student Instructions Template
```
ENHANCED TUTORIAL - Documents Practice Included!

1. Run: python tutorial.py
2. Student ID: [your university email]
3. Choose: [lesson number or 'all']
4. Assignment Key: [instructor provided]
5. Complete exercises using real sample files
6. Submit codes in Canvas as they appear

New Features:
- Navigate to Documents/ directory with sample files
- Compare file sizes using ls -l command  
- Read actual file content with cat command  
- Practice with various file types and sizes
- Enhanced command validation prevents terminal hanging
```

### 5. Key Learning Objectives
**File Size Analysis:**
- Students learn to read `ls -l` output
- Compare files from 12 bytes to 1,775 bytes
- Understand file size implications

**Content Exploration:**
- Read meaningful file content with `cat`
- Search for specific terms with `grep`
- Count lines/words in real documents

**Realistic Practice:**
- Work with actual documentation files
- Navigate structured directories
- Practice with executable scripts### 5. Answer Key CSV Format
```csv
Student ID,Group,Checkpoint_5,Checkpoint_10,Checkpoint_15,Checkpoint_20,Checkpoint_25,Checkpoint_30,Checkpoint_35,Checkpoint_40,Checkpoint_45,Checkpoint_50
john@uni.edu,Group B,9GEKX,SOV5K,QM8PL,RT4NW,KL9XC,MN7ZY,PQ3VB,AB2CD,EF5GH,IJ8KL
jane@uni.edu,Group C,QS9OW,OLPAK,WE6TR,UI9OP,AS5DF,GH2JK,ZX8CV,MQ4NB,VC7XZ,LP1MN
```

### 6. Assessment Ideas
**File Analysis Questions:**
- "What is the size of project.txt in bytes?"
- "Which file contains information about students?"
- "How many lines are in the commands.txt file?"

**Command Practice:**
- "Use grep to find all students studying 'Computer Science'"
- "Display the first 3 lines of project.txt"
- "Make script.sh executable and verify with ls -l"

**Directory Navigation:**
- "Navigate to Documents and list all files with sizes"
- "Find the smallest file and display its content"

### 7. Troubleshooting
**Common Issues:**
- **Codes don't match**: Check assignment key and student ID format
- **Missing codes**: Student may not have reached checkpoint (every 5 exercises)
- **Command hanging**: New validation prevents incomplete commands like "as"
- **File not found**: Ensure students are in correct directory (Documents/)

**Testing Tools:**
- Use option 8 in generator to test individual student
- Verify Documents/ directory exists with sample files
- Check that all 7 sample files are present with correct sizes

**File Verification:**
```bash
# Quick check of Documents directory
cd Documents && ls -l
# Should show 7 files ranging from 12 to 1,775 bytes
```
