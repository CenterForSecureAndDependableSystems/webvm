# Password-based encryption
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt -out file.enc -k password

# Key-based encryption with explicit IV
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt -out file.enc -K $(cat key.hex) -iv $(cat iv.hex)

# Base64 encoding for safe transmission
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -in file.txt -out file.b64 -k password
```

### Asymmetric Encryption
```bash
# Generate RSA key pair
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem

# Encrypt/decrypt with RSA
openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public.pem -in message.txt -out encrypted.bin

```

## Security Considerations

### Educational Environment
- **Sample Data Only**: All exercises use non-sensitive sample files
- **Temporary Keys**: Cryptographic keys are generated for learning only
- **No Production Use**: Tutorial demonstrates concepts, not production security

### Best Practices Taught
- **Strong Key Generation**: Proper random key generation methods
- **Algorithm Selection**: When to use different cryptographic algorithms
- **Key Management**: Proper storage and protection of cryptographic keys
- **Verification Importance**: Always verify cryptographic operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenSSL Not Found**:
   ```
   Error: 'openssl' is not recognized as an internal or external command
   ```
   **Solution**: Install OpenSSL and ensure it's in your system PATH

2. **Permission Denied**:
   ```
   Error: Permission denied when creating files
   ```
   **Solution**: Run from a directory where you have write permissions

3. **Python Version**:
   ```
   Error: SyntaxError or module import issues
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed and being used

### Verification Commands

Test your setup:
```bash
# Test Python
python --version

# Test OpenSSL
openssl version

# Test file creation permissions
echo "test" > test.txt && rm test.txt
```
