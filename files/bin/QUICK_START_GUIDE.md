## üí° Quick Tips

### For Instructors:
- **Test First**: Always run `test_navigation_quiz.py` before class
- **Unique Keys**: Use different assignment keys for different classes
- **Save CSV**: The answer key CSV imports easily into most LMS systems
- **Backup Codes**: Keep the generated answer key file safe

### For Students:
- **Use Tab**: Tab completion makes navigation faster
- **Try `ls -la`**: Shows hidden files and details
- **Use `find`**: Best tool for locating specific files
- **Read Carefully**: Questions ask for specific formats (paths vs names)
- **Practice Commands**: `cd`, `ls`, `find`, `cat`, `wc`, `du`
